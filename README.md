# Command Line Rust

This the project repository working along side the book "Command-Line Rust" written by Ken Youens-Clark, published by O'Reilly.

The general idea is to learn Rust by implementing several command line tools that are commonly used within POSIX environments.

## Licensing

This repository does not claim to be a faithful reproduction of the book, I'm likely to diverge if I stick with it long enough.

See the book for licensing details.  Not a lawyer interpretation: it can be used for most purposes that code is used for, but avoid selling/redistributing in ways that are competitive with the purposes of the book itself (i.e. teaching and learning).
